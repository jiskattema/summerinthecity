-- Standard deviation of building height STDH_URB2D URB_PARAM=93
-- definition of building a bit arbitrary (ie. the TOP10NL objects)
-- A grid cell can 'cut' a building in parts. The parts in the same cell are still considred one building.
-- Its height is then the average over OHN of the intersecting parts.
--  
-- arguments: pixel, geometry    grid cell to analyze
-- 
-- depends on: gebouw, the TOP10NL table for buildings
--             ohn, the object height map, relative to maaiveld (ie. building height)
--
-- returns: stddev building height [m], always >= 0
