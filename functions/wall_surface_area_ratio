-- Building wall surface area ratio LF_URB2D URB_PARAM=95
-- or lambda_b. Sum of wall surface area plus roof divided by the gridcell
--  
-- arguments: pixel, geometry    grid cell to analyze
-- 
-- depends on: gebouwview, the TOP10NL table for buildings extended with a building height column called 'mean'
--
-- returns: building wall surface plus roof, divided by grid cell area [m2/m2 grid cell], always >= 0
